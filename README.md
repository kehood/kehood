# üëã Hi, I'm Kevin Hood

Former ASE Master Automotive Technician turned self-taught programmer.  With nearly two decades in automotive diagnostics, high-performance tuning, and small business operations, I've channeled that experience and work ethic into software development. Professional expertise in PHP, .NET, and Python, with hands-on experience integrating countless vendor APIs, cloud migrations, automating processes, and building data-driven apps.  On the side, I've explored countless languages and enjoy personal projects in game dev and more.  Passionate about bonsai trees and the quote: *The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago.  The second best time is right now.*

üå± **Currently growing:** More API integrations, cloud solutions, and innovative tools for legal and marketing industries. Side questing React, to stay up to speed.

## üå≥ Personal Vibes

Big nerd at heart.  When not working, I'm tending my bonsai trees or diving into board games.  Life motto: The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago.  The second best time is right now. üåø
